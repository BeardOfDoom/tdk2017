STATE_ATTRIBUTES:
Attr1 is matrix[1][3] of number
Attr2 is matrix[1][3] of number

STATE_START:
$1[0][0] = 5
$1[0][1] = 0
$1[0][2] = 0

$2[0][0] = 5
$2[0][1] = 3
$2[0][2] = 2

STATE_GOAL:
$1[0][0] == 4

OPERATORS:

OPERATOR_DESCRIPTION:
cost 1
param i from 0 to 2 by 1
param j from 0 to 2 by 1

OPERATOR_PRECONDITION:
i!=j and
$1[0][i]!=0 and
$1[0][j]!=$2[0][j]

OPERATOR_EFFECT:
var number beer =  min($1[0][i], $2[0][j] - $1[0][j])
$1[0][i] = $1[0][i] - beer
$1[0][j] = $1[0][j] + beer
